The Frontier. A time when every man and woman alike looks to the horizon. Pioneers they called us, but all we tried to do was live day by day. Lured by stories of fortune, those lucky folk who 'struck it rich', or for a chance at infamy with desire to be great they came from every corner of the cloud.
Only by coming together can these brave folk survive in a world oft heard as merciless surpass the nay sayers' taunts of 'doomed-to-failure'.  "-If I have seen far it is because I have stood on the shoulder's of giants-"   During the Bonanza giants are born through the summation of the many & when the dusty grit of today passes to legend, giants they will be.
